Setting up the right filters ensures only newsletters reach your Summate inbox, not your personal emails. Here are proven filtering strategies:

## Filter Strategies

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Platform-Specific Filters" icon="envelope">
    **Newsletter Platforms:**
    - Substack: `from:substack.com`
    - Beehiiv: `from:beehiiv.com`
    - ConvertKit: `from:convertkit.com`
    - Ghost: `from:ghost.io`
    - Mailchimp: `from:mailchimp.com`

    These filters catch all newsletters from major platforms.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Smart Keyword Filters" icon="filter">
    **Combine multiple criteria for accuracy:**
    - `from:newsletter AND has:unsubscribe`
    - `subject:"weekly" OR subject:"daily" OR subject:"digest"`
    - `from:noreply AND has:unsubscribe`

    More specific = fewer false positives.

## Universal "Unsubscribe" Filter

<Warning>
**Use with caution:** The "has the words: unsubscribe" filter catches most newsletters but may also forward:
- Order confirmations
- Service notifications
- Marketing emails
- Account updates

For best results, combine with sender filters or use more specific criteria.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Follow these guidelines for better filtering:**

1. **Start specific** - Begin with known newsletter senders
2. **Test first** - Apply filters to existing emails before enabling forwarding
3. **Refine regularly** - Review what's being forwarded weekly
4. **Use labels** - Mark forwarded emails in your main inbox for easy tracking
</Tip>

## Example Filter Combinations

Here are some example filter combinations that work well:

### Gmail Syntax

```
from:(substack.com OR beehiiv.com OR ghost.io) has:unsubscribe
```

```
subject:(newsletter OR digest OR weekly OR daily) has:unsubscribe
```

```
from:noreply has:unsubscribe -is:chat
```

### Outlook Syntax

- **From** contains: `substack.com` OR `beehiiv.com`
- **Body** contains: `unsubscribe`

### Advanced: List-Id Header (Fastmail/ProtonMail)

The most accurate way to identify newsletters is using the `List-Id` header, which is specifically designed for mailing lists:

```
List-Id exists
```

This catches legitimate newsletters while avoiding promotional emails.

## Provider-Specific Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Gmail">
    - Use the search bar to test filters before creating them
    - Apply filters to existing emails to see what would be caught
    - Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR operators
    - Use `-` (minus) to exclude certain criteria
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Outlook">
    - Create multiple simple rules rather than one complex rule
    - Test rules on existing emails first
    - Use "Mark as read" to keep your inbox clean
    - Consider using categories for better organization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fastmail">
    - Use Sieve filters for maximum flexibility
    - Check "List-Id" header for most accurate filtering
    - Use "Send a copy to" instead of "Forward" for better deliverability
    - Test with "discard" action first to see what would match
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ProtonMail">
    - Combine multiple conditions for accuracy
    - Use "From contains" for newsletter platforms
    - Test with a single newsletter first
    - Review forwarded emails regularly to refine rules
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Emails Being Forwarded

If you're forwarding too many non-newsletter emails:

1. **Add more specific conditions** - Use sender domains or subject keywords
2. **Exclude certain senders** - Add exceptions for transactional emails
3. **Review forwarded emails** - Check what's being caught and adjust
4. **Use List-Id** - If your provider supports it (most accurate)

### Missing Newsletters

If newsletters aren't being forwarded:

1. **Check if they match your filter** - Test with the email in question
2. **Look for the sender domain** - Some newsletters come from unexpected domains
3. **Check your spam folder** - Filters don't apply to spam
4. **Verify forwarding is enabled** - Ensure your Summate inbox is verified
