description: Complete step-by-step guide to set up selective auto-forwarding from Gmail to Summate
---

This guide will walk you through setting up selective auto-forwarding from Gmail to your Summate inbox. The process takes about 5 minutes and involves verifying your Summate inbox address and creating filters to forward newsletters.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Gmail Settings">
    Click the gear icon in Gmail and select "See all settings".

    <Frame>
      <div className="flex flex-row gap-10">
        <img
          src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_1_1.png"
          alt="Gmail gear icon"
          style={{ marginRight: "10px" }}
        />
        <img
          src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_1_2.png"
          alt="Gmail settings menu"
          style={{ marginLeft: "10px" }}
        />
      </div>
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Forwarding and POP/IMAP">
    Click on the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab in the settings menu.

    <Frame>

        alt="Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new Forwarding Address">
    Click "Add a forwarding address" button.

    <Warning>
      **Important:** Do NOT enable "Forward a copy of incoming mail to..."

      This would forward ALL your emails. Instead, you'll set up selective forwarding with filters in Step 8.
    </Warning>

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your Summate inbox address">
    Enter your unique Summate inbox: `username@inbox.summate.io`

    You should have received this during onboarding. If you haven't, visit [your inbox page](https://summate.io/v2/inbox?ref=docs.summate.io) to find it.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize your request">
    Gmail will ask you to verify your identity (possibly through 2FA).

    After authorization, Gmail sends a verification link to your Summate inbox.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the verification email">
    1. Navigate to [your Summate inbox](https://summate.io/v2/inbox?ref=docs.summate.io)
    2. Look for a new sender in the pending section
    3. Click on the Gmail verification email

        alt="Gmail verification email in Summate inbox"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete verification">
    Copy the verification link from the email (it starts with `https://mail-settings.google.com/mail/...`) and paste it into your browser.

        alt="Verification link in email"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up forwarding filters">
    Now that your Summate address is verified, create filters to selectively forward newsletters.

    **Part A: Go to Filters and Blocked Addresses**

        src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_8_1.png"
        alt="Filters and blocked addresses tab"
      />
    </Frame>

    **Part B: Create a new filter**

    Click "Create a new filter" and specify your criteria (e.g., from a specific sender).

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_8_2.png"
        alt="Create new filter dialog"
      />
    </Frame>

    **Part C: Configure forwarding action**

    1. Check "Forward it to" and select your Summate inbox
    2. Optionally check "Mark as read" to keep your inbox clean
    3. Click "Create filter"

    <Frame>
      <img
