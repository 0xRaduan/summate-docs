</Note>

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Forwarding Rule">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Rules** (or **Filters & Rules**)
    2. Click **Create rule**
    3. Add conditions to identify newsletters:
       - **From** contains common newsletter domains
       - **Subject** contains newsletter keywords
       - **List-Id** header exists (most accurate)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Forward Action">
    Choose the action type:
    - **Send a copy to**: Enter `username@inbox.summate.io`
      - Preserves original sender (recommended)
      - Better for DMARC compliance
    - **Forward**: Re-sends from your address
      - Replies come back to you
  </Step>

  <Step title="Advanced Filtering (Optional)">
    For power users, use Sieve scripting:

    ```sieve
    # Forward newsletters based on List-Id header
    if header :contains "List-Id" "newsletter" {
      redirect :copy "username@inbox.summate.io";
      keep;
    }
    ```

    Access via Settings → Advanced → Sieve Filtering
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Fastmail's "Send a copy to" (redirect) typically has better deliverability than traditional forwarding, especially with strict DMARC policies.
