<Info>
ProtonMail supports selective forwarding with custom rules on **paid plans only**. Free accounts cannot use auto-forwarding.
</Info>

## Security Note

When forwarding from ProtonMail to non-Proton addresses (like Summate), emails will **not** be end-to-end encrypted. Only the emails matching your forwarding rules are affected.

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Forwarding Settings">
    1. Sign in at [mail.proton.me](https://mail.proton.me)
    2. Click **Settings (gear icon)** → **All settings**
    3. Navigate to **Proton Mail** → **Auto-reply and forward**
    4. Click **Forward emails** → **Add forwarding rule**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Selective Forwarding Rule">
    1. **Forward from**: Select your Proton address
    2. **Forward to**: Enter `username@inbox.summate.io`
    3. Click **Add condition** for selective forwarding:
       - **From** contains: newsletter domains
       - **Subject** contains: "newsletter", "digest", "weekly"
       - Add multiple conditions for accuracy
    4. Click **Send confirmation email**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Verification">
    1. Check your Summate inbox for the verification email
    2. Click **Accept forwarding** in the email
    3. Your rule is now active

    Manage rules anytime from **Auto-reply and forward** → **Forward emails**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For advanced filtering, use ProtonMail's **Sieve filters** (Settings → Filters → Add sieve filter) for header-level matching and complex logic.
