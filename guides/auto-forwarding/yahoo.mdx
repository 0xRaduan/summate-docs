description: Set up auto-forwarding for Yahoo Mail (paid plans only)
---

<Warning>
Yahoo Mail only supports **all-or-nothing** forwarding on paid plans (Yahoo Mail Plus). There's no way to forward only newsletters - all emails will be forwarded to Summate.
</Warning>

## Requirements

- **Yahoo Mail Plus** or **Access + Forwarding** subscription (not available on free accounts)
- Verification of forwarding address

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Forwarding Settings">
    1. Open Yahoo Mail in your browser
    2. Click the **Settings gear** → **More settings**
    3. Navigate to **Mailboxes**
    4. Click on your primary email account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Auto-Forwarding">
    1. Find the **Auto-forwarding** section
    2. Enter your Summate inbox: `username@inbox.summate.io`
    3. Click **Verify**
    4. Check your Summate inbox for verification email
    5. Complete verification and **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Important Limitation:** Yahoo filters can move emails to folders but **cannot** forward them. If you need selective forwarding for newsletters only, consider using a different email provider.
</Note>

## Recommendation

Given Yahoo's all-or-nothing limitation, we recommend one of these alternatives:

1. **Use a different provider** - Gmail, Outlook, or Fastmail support selective forwarding
2. **Create a forwarding chain** - Forward Yahoo → Gmail → Summate with filters in Gmail
3. **Manual forwarding** - Forward individual newsletters as needed
