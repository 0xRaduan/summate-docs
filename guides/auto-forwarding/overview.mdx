## Overview

Instead of subscribing to all newsletters manually again, you can set up auto-forwarding and send a copy of selected newsletters from your main inbox to your [summate inbox](/concepts/inbox), automatically.

The overall process typically takes about 5 minutes of time, and generally requires two things:

- add your `@inbox.summate.io` email to your approved forwarding addresses
- setup filters to forward newsletters to your `@inbox.summate.io` email

## Security First

<Info>
**Why we use email forwarding instead of OAuth**

We deliberately chose email forwarding over direct inbox access for two key reasons:

1. **Universal Compatibility** - Works with every email provider (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, ProtonMail, corporate emails, etc.) without special integrations

2. **Privacy by Design** - We only see emails you explicitly choose to forward. Your personal emails, bank statements, and sensitive communications stay completely private. We never have access to your full inbox.

This approach gives you complete control over what content reaches Summate while keeping your email account secure.

## General Tips

Once you've set up forwarding for your email provider:

1. **Test with one newsletter** - Send a test email to verify forwarding works
2. **Check your Summate inbox** - Confirm the email arrives at [your inbox page](https://summate.io/v2/inbox?ref=docs.summate.io)
3. **Refine your filters** - Adjust rules based on what's being forwarded
4. **Review regularly** - Check weekly to ensure only newsletters are forwarded
