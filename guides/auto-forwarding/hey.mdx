<Warning>
HEY only supports **all-or-nothing** forwarding. You cannot forward only newsletters - it's either everything or nothing. HEY's philosophy doesn't include traditional email rules or filters.
</Warning>

## How HEY Handles Newsletters

HEY automatically routes newsletters to **The Feed** (a separate view), but there's no way to auto-forward only Feed items to external addresses.

## Setup Instructions (All Emails)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Global Forwarding (If Needed)">
    If you must forward all emails:

    1. Go to [app.hey.com/accounts](https://app.hey.com/accounts)
    2. Select your account
    3. Navigate to **Forwarding & Sending**
    4. Add `username@inbox.summate.io` as forwarding address
    5. Complete verification

    **Note:** This forwards ALL emails except spam
  </Step>

  <Step title="Alternative Approach">
    For selective forwarding, consider this workaround:

    1. Forward everything from HEY to another provider (Gmail/Fastmail)
    2. Set up selective rules in that provider
    3. Forward only newsletters to Summate from there

    This adds complexity but enables selective forwarding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Given HEY's limitations, most users find it easier to manually forward individual newsletters or use HEY's built-in Feed feature instead of auto-forwarding.
</Note>

## Recommendation

If you're a HEY user and want to use Summate with selective forwarding, we recommend:

1. **Use HEY's Feed** - Keep newsletters in HEY's Feed view
2. **Manual forwarding** - Forward specific newsletters you want in Summate
3. **Forwarding chain** - HEY → Gmail → Summate (with filters in Gmail)
4. **Different provider for newsletters** - Use Gmail/Fastmail for newsletter subscriptions
