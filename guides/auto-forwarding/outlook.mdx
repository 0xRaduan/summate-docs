## Troubleshooting: External Forwarding Blocked

If you see this error when trying to forward emails:

<Warning>
```
550 5.7.520 Access denied, Your organization does not allow external forwarding.
Please contact your administrator for further assistance. AS(7550)
```

This means your Microsoft 365 account has external forwarding disabled. You'll need administrator access to enable it.
