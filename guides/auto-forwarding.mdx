## Overview

Instead of subscribing to all newsletters manually again, you can set up auto-forwarding and send a copy of selected newsletters from your main inbox to your [summate inbox](/concepts/inbox), automatically.

The overall process typically takes about 5 minutes of time, and generally requires two things:

- add your `@inbox.summate.io` email to your approved forwarding addresses
- setup filters to forward newsletters to your `@inbox.summate.io` email

## Security First

<Info>
**Why we use email forwarding instead of OAuth**

We deliberately chose email forwarding over direct inbox access for two key reasons:

1. **Universal Compatibility** - Works with every email provider (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, ProtonMail, corporate emails, etc.) without special integrations

2. **Privacy by Design** - We only see emails you explicitly choose to forward. Your personal emails, bank statements, and sensitive communications stay completely private. We never have access to your full inbox.

This approach gives you complete control over what content reaches Summate while keeping your email account secure.

</Info>

## Step-by-step guide for Yahoo Mail

<Warning>
Yahoo Mail only supports **all-or-nothing** forwarding on paid plans (Yahoo Mail Plus). There's no way to forward only newsletters - all emails will be forwarded to Summate.
</Warning>

### Requirements
- **Yahoo Mail Plus** or **Access + Forwarding** subscription (not available on free accounts)
- Verification of forwarding address

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Forwarding Settings">
    1. Open Yahoo Mail in your browser
    2. Click the **Settings gear** → **More settings**
    3. Navigate to **Mailboxes**
    4. Click on your primary email account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Auto-Forwarding">
    1. Find the **Auto-forwarding** section
    2. Enter your Summate inbox: `username@inbox.summate.io`
    3. Click **Verify**
    4. Check your Summate inbox for verification email
    5. Complete verification and **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Important Limitation:** Yahoo filters can move emails to folders but **cannot** forward them. If you need selective forwarding for newsletters only, consider using a different email provider.
</Note>

## Step-by-step guide for ProtonMail

<Info>
ProtonMail supports selective forwarding with custom rules on **paid plans only**. Free accounts cannot use auto-forwarding.
</Info>

### Security Note
When forwarding from ProtonMail to non-Proton addresses (like Summate), emails will **not** be end-to-end encrypted. Only the emails matching your forwarding rules are affected.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Forwarding Settings">
    1. Sign in at [mail.proton.me](https://mail.proton.me)
    2. Click **Settings (gear icon)** → **All settings**
    3. Navigate to **Proton Mail** → **Auto-reply and forward**
    4. Click **Forward emails** → **Add forwarding rule**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Selective Forwarding Rule">
    1. **Forward from**: Select your Proton address
    2. **Forward to**: Enter `username@inbox.summate.io`
    3. Click **Add condition** for selective forwarding:
       - **From** contains: newsletter domains
       - **Subject** contains: "newsletter", "digest", "weekly"
       - Add multiple conditions for accuracy
    4. Click **Send confirmation email**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Verification">
    1. Check your Summate inbox for the verification email
    2. Click **Accept forwarding** in the email
    3. Your rule is now active

    Manage rules anytime from **Auto-reply and forward** → **Forward emails**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For advanced filtering, use ProtonMail's **Sieve filters** (Settings → Filters → Add sieve filter) for header-level matching and complex logic.
</Tip>

## Step-by-step guide for Fastmail

<Note>
Fastmail offers excellent forwarding capabilities with both simple rules and advanced Sieve filters.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Forwarding Rule">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Rules** (or **Filters & Rules**)
    2. Click **Create rule**
    3. Add conditions to identify newsletters:
       - **From** contains common newsletter domains
       - **Subject** contains newsletter keywords
       - **List-Id** header exists (most accurate)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Forward Action">
    Choose the action type:
    - **Send a copy to**: Enter `username@inbox.summate.io`
      - Preserves original sender (recommended)
      - Better for DMARC compliance
    - **Forward**: Re-sends from your address
      - Replies come back to you
  </Step>

  <Step title="Advanced Filtering (Optional)">
    For power users, use Sieve scripting:

    ```sieve
    # Forward newsletters based on List-Id header
    if header :contains "List-Id" "newsletter" {
      redirect :copy "username@inbox.summate.io";
      keep;
    }
    ```

    Access via Settings → Advanced → Sieve Filtering
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Fastmail's "Send a copy to" (redirect) typically has better deliverability than traditional forwarding, especially with strict DMARC policies.
</Info>

## Step-by-step guide for HEY

<Warning>
HEY only supports **all-or-nothing** forwarding. You cannot forward only newsletters - it's either everything or nothing. HEY's philosophy doesn't include traditional email rules or filters.
</Warning>

### How HEY Handles Newsletters
HEY automatically routes newsletters to **The Feed** (a separate view), but there's no way to auto-forward only Feed items to external addresses.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Global Forwarding (If Needed)">
    If you must forward all emails:

    1. Go to [app.hey.com/accounts](https://app.hey.com/accounts)
    2. Select your account
    3. Navigate to **Forwarding & Sending**
    4. Add `username@inbox.summate.io` as forwarding address
    5. Complete verification

    **Note:** This forwards ALL emails except spam
  </Step>

  <Step title="Alternative Approach">
    For selective forwarding, consider this workaround:

    1. Forward everything from HEY to another provider (Gmail/Fastmail)
    2. Set up selective rules in that provider
    3. Forward only newsletters to Summate from there

    This adds complexity but enables selective forwarding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Given HEY's limitations, most users find it easier to manually forward individual newsletters or use HEY's built-in Feed feature instead of auto-forwarding.
</Note>

## Recommended Filter Settings

Setting up the right filters ensures only newsletters reach your Summate inbox, not your personal emails. Here are proven filtering strategies:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Platform-Specific Filters" icon="envelope">
    **Newsletter Platforms:**
    - Substack: `from:substack.com`
    - Beehiiv: `from:beehiiv.com`
    - ConvertKit: `from:convertkit.com`
    - Ghost: `from:ghost.io`
    - Mailchimp: `from:mailchimp.com`

    These filters catch all newsletters from major platforms.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Smart Keyword Filters" icon="filter">
    **Combine multiple criteria for accuracy:**
    - `from:newsletter AND has:unsubscribe`
    - `subject:"weekly" OR subject:"daily" OR subject:"digest"`
    - `from:noreply AND has:unsubscribe`

    More specific = fewer false positives.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Universal "Unsubscribe" Filter

<Warning>
**Use with caution:** The "has the words: unsubscribe" filter catches most newsletters but may also forward:
- Order confirmations
- Service notifications
- Marketing emails
- Account updates

For best results, combine with sender filters or use more specific criteria.
</Warning>

### Tips for Better Filtering

<Tip>
**Best Practices:**
1. **Start specific** - Begin with known newsletter senders
2. **Test first** - Apply filters to existing emails before enabling forwarding
3. **Refine regularly** - Review what's being forwarded weekly
4. **Use labels** - Mark forwarded emails in your main inbox for easy tracking
</Tip>
