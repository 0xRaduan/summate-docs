Instead of adding Substack newsletters one by one, you can connect your Substack account and import all your subscriptions at once.

<Warning>
**Paid Substack subscribers: Use email forwarding instead**

If you're subscribed to paid Substacks, this import feature will only capture the free preview, not the full content. We **strongly recommend** using [email auto-forwarding](/guides/auto-forwarding/overview) and adding your newsletters to an [Email block](/concepts/blocks#email-blocks) instead. This way, you'll get the complete content of paid newsletters.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Best for quick imports:** This feature is designed as a fast way to bring in all your free Substack subscriptions. For better management and full control, consider using [email forwarding](/guides/auto-forwarding/overview) to add newsletters to an Email block instead.

This import is available when adding an RSS block. You can also add individual Substack newsletters by pasting their URLs directly.

## Connecting Your Substack Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your Substack profile URL">
    Navigate to substack.com and click on your profile icon, then click on your name to view your profile.

    <Frame caption="Click on your profile icon and then your name">
      <img
        src="/images/substack/substack_connect_1.png"
        alt="Substack profile navigation"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make your 'Reads' section public">
    For Summate to import your subscriptions, your 'Reads' section must be public.

    <Frame caption="Example profile showing the Reads section">
      <img
        src="/images/substack/substack_connect_2_1.png"
        alt="Substack profile with Reads section"
      />
    </Frame>

    Click **'Edit Profile'** and scroll down to the **'Reads'** section. Here you can choose which newsletters to make public.

    <Frame caption="Configure which newsletters are visible in your public Reads">
      <img
        src="/images/substack/substack_connect_2_2.png"
        alt="Substack Reads privacy settings"
      />
    </Frame>

    <Tip>
      You only need to make your Reads public during the import. After syncing with Summate, you can make them private again.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect in Summate">
    In Summate, when creating or editing an RSS block, click **'Import your Substack'**.

    <Frame caption="Click the Import Substack button in your RSS block">
      <img
        src="/images/substack/substack_connect_3_1.png"
        alt="Import Substack button in Summate"
      />
    </Frame>

    Enter your Substack profile URL in the format:
    - `https://substack.com/@username` or
    - `https://substack.com/profile/username`

    <Frame caption="Enter your Substack profile URL">
      <img
        src="/images/substack/substack_connect_3_2.png"
        alt="Substack profile URL input"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select subscriptions to import">
    Summate will fetch all your public subscriptions. Select which ones you want to add to your RSS block.

    <Frame caption="Choose which Substack newsletters to import">
      <img
        src="/images/substack/substack_connect_3_3.png"
        alt="Substack subscription selection"
      />
    </Frame>

    The selected newsletters will be added as sources in your RSS block.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Import

Once imported, your Substack newsletters will appear as RSS sources in your block. You can:

- View them in the RSS block's Sources tab
- Remove individual newsletters if needed
- Import additional Substack accounts following the same process

<Note>
Substack newsletters imported this way are treated as RSS feeds. They'll be summarized just like any other blog or RSS source in your digest.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import not working" icon="circle-exclamation">
    - Verify your Reads section is public
    - Check that your profile URL is correct
    - Try using the alternative URL format (`@username` vs `profile/username`)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some newsletters missing" icon="list">
    Only newsletters visible in your public Reads will be imported. Check your Reads privacy settings and make sure the newsletters you want are set to public.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Already have newsletters via email" icon="envelope">
    If you're already receiving Substack newsletters via [email forwarding](/guides/auto-forwarding/overview), you don't need to import them as RSS sources. You can add them to an Email block instead.
  </Accordion>
