Summate is built around two simple but powerful concepts: **Digests** and **Blocks**.

## What is a Digest?

A digest is your personalized content collection delivered on your schedule. Think of it as your own custom newspaper that arrives exactly when you want it.

Each digest can:
- Focus on a specific topic (AI news, morning brief, market updates)
- Arrive on your chosen schedule (daily at 7 AM, weekly on Sundays, etc.)
- Use your preferred format (quick bullets or detailed summaries)

## What are Blocks?

Blocks are content sections within your digest. Each block pulls content from different sources:

- **Newsletter Blocks** - Summaries from your email subscriptions
- **YouTube Blocks** - Key takeaways from channels you follow
- **RSS Blocks** - Updates from blogs and news sites

## How They Work Together

1. **Create a digest** for your topic (e.g., "Tech News")
2. **Add blocks** from your sources (TechCrunch RSS, YouTube tech channels, newsletters)
3. **Set your schedule** (daily at 8 AM)
4. **Receive and read** via email or web

## Example: Morning Brief Digest

Here's what a typical morning digest might include:

- **News Block** → Top stories from your favorite news sites
- **Newsletter Block** → Highlights from Morning Brew, The Information
- **YouTube Block** → Key points from channels you missed yesterday
