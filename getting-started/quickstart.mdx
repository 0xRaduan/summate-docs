  <Step title="Customize Your Digests">
    After onboarding, you'll have digests generated for you. You can customize them by adding or removing [blocks](/concepts/blocks):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Email Block">
        0. Create a special [Summate Inbox](/concepts/inbox)
        1. Forward your newsletters to your AI inbox ([see our setup guide](/guides/auto-forwarding)) or subscribe to new newsletters with this address.
        2. Select which ones to include in this digest or mark "Include All" so all newsletters received will be included.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="YouTube Block">
        1. Paste YouTube channel URLs
        2. Or connect your YouTube account to select from your subscriptions.

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="RSS Block">
        1. Add blog or news site URLs
        2. Summate tries it's best to find the RSS feed automatically. If it doesn't work, try adding RSS feed directly.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
