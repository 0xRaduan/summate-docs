<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up & Complete Onboarding">
    Go to [summate.io](https://summate.io) and click "Start free trial". During onboarding:

    1. **Tell us about yourself** - Share your interests so AI can personalize your summaries
    2. **Connect your accounts** - Link YouTube and Substack for quick setup
    3. **Get personalized digests** - We'll create digests based on your profile, or choose from our curated library

    **What you get:**
    - 14-day free trial
    - 2000 AI credits per month
    - Pre-configured digests based on your interests

    <Tip>
      The more you share during onboarding, the better we can tailor your digest recommendations and AI summaries.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Your Digests">
    After onboarding, you'll have digests already created for you. Customize them by adding, removing, or editing [blocks](/concepts/blocks):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Email Block">
        For newsletters you receive via email:

        1. **Create your [Summate Inbox](/concepts/inbox)** - Get a unique address like `username@inbox.summate.io`
        2. **Forward newsletters** to your inbox ([setup guide](/guides/auto-forwarding))
        3. **Select senders** to include, or choose "Include All" for automatic inclusion

        <Info>
          All approved senders are available as sources. Block spam senders with one click.
        </Info>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="YouTube Block">
        For YouTube channels you follow:

        1. Connect your YouTube account to import subscriptions, or
        2. Paste channel URLs manually
        3. Select which channels to include

        <Tip>
          If you connected YouTube during onboarding, your subscriptions are already imported!
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="RSS Block">
        For blogs and news sites:

        1. Paste website URLs - Summate auto-detects RSS feeds
        2. Or add RSS feed URLs directly if auto-detection fails
        3. Import Substack subscriptions ([see guide](/guides/substack-import))

        <Tip>
          If you connected Substack during onboarding, your newsletters may already be added!
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  <Step title="Customize AI Summaries (Optional)">
    By default, you get **Detailed Summaries** with TLDR and clickable key takeaways. Add custom instructions to personalize what AI focuses on:

    - **Block-level**: "Focus on pricing and business models"
    - **Digest-level**: "Emphasize actionable insights"
    - **Account-level**: "Write for a technical audience"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Your Schedule">
    Your digests come with recommended schedules, but you can adjust when to receive them:

    - **Daily** - Every day at your chosen time (multiple times allowed, 4hr minimum apart)
    - **Weekly** - Pick specific day(s) and time
    - **Monthly** - Choose which days of the month

    <Tip>
      Set your timezone during onboarding or later in [account settings](/account).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate Your Digest">
    Digests start in **Draft** state so you can review before activation:

    1. Review your blocks, sources, and schedule
    2. Click **Activate** when ready
    3. Your first digest arrives at the next scheduled time

    <Warning>
      Once activated, your digest will be generated and sent automatically. You can pause or edit it anytime.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Next?

When your scheduled time arrives, your digest will:
1. **Collect new content** from all your sources since the last digest
2. **Generate AI summaries** based on your [custom instructions](/concepts/ai)
3. **Deliver to your email** inbox and make available on the [web reader](/reading/web)

<Info>
Digests are always delivered **both via email and web**. No need to chooseâ€”read wherever is most convenient.
