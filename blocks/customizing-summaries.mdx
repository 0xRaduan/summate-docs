```

The sweet spot for most users:

## Smart Filtering

### Relevance Scoring

AI scores each item 1-10:
- **9-10**: Must read
- **7-8**: Recommended
- **5-6**: Optional
- **Below 5**: Filtered out

Set minimum score per block or digest.

### Duplicate Detection

Avoid reading same story twice:
- Cross-source deduplication
- Similar story grouping
- Original source attribution

### Time-Based Filtering

- **Breaking news** - Last 24 hours only
- **Weekly roundup** - Past 7 days
- **Monthly digest** - Extended timeframe

**Example: YouTube - Fireship**
- Timestamp all code examples
- Include terminal commands
- Technical tone

### Conditional Formatting

"If this, then that" rules:
