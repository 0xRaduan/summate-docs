description: Understanding how AI credits work in Summate
---

Think of AI credits as your monthly summary allowance. Each piece of content you want summarized uses credits based on its size and type.

## How Credits Work

### Content Types & Credit Usage

**Articles and Newsletters**
- 1 credit per item

**YouTube Videos**
- Under 30 minutes: 1 credit
- 30 minutes to 2 hours: 2 credits
- Over 2 hours: 3 credits

### Monthly Allocation

All paid plans include **2000 AI credits per month** - plenty for most users. Your credits refresh on the 1st of every month.

## What Happens When Credits Run Out?

If you exhaust your monthly credits:
- You'll need to wait until the next month for credits to refresh
- Or purchase a credits add-on to continue processing content

## Common Questions

**How many items can I process with 2000 credits?**
Most users process 50-100 items per month, well within the 2000 credit limit. Heavy users who process multiple digests daily might use more.

**Do unused credits roll over?**
No, credits reset each month and don't accumulate.

**What doesn't use credits?**
- Reading previously generated digests
- Managing your sources and settings
- Using the browser extension's Save for Later feature (free accounts)

## Tips for Managing Credits

1. **Focus on quality sources** - Better to summarize 10 great articles than 100 mediocre ones
2. **Use digest scheduling wisely** - Daily digests use more credits than weekly ones
3. **Remove duplicate sources** - No need to summarize the same story from multiple outlets
4. **Monitor your usage** - Check your credit balance in account settings
