Digests are your personalized content bundles, delivered on your schedule. Think of them as your custom newspaper, assembled from all your sources.

## What is a Digest?

A digest is a curated collection of content from your chosen sources, delivered at specific times. Each digest can be tailored for different purposes - a morning news brief, weekly industry roundup, or weekend reading list.

## Managing Digests

From your dashboard:

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** - Create one focused digest first
2. **Test timing** - Adjust based on when you actually read
3. **Group related content** - Keep each digest focused
4. **Use preview** - Test changes before committing
