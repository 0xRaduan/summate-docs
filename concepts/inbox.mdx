## Setting Up Your Inbox

### Create Your Inbox Address

Every Summate user gets a unique inbox address in the format:

```
username@inbox.summate.io
```

<Warning>
You can only create your inbox address **once**, so choose a good username! This becomes your permanent address for receiving newsletters.
</Warning>

### Start Receiving Newsletters

Once you have your inbox address, you have two options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-Forwarding (Recommended)">
    **Best for:** Existing newsletter subscriptions

    Set up automatic forwarding from your email provider to your Summate Inbox. This is the recommended approach and takes about 5 minutes.

    <Card title="Complete Setup Guide" icon="arrow-right" href="/guides/auto-forwarding">
      Follow our step-by-step guide for Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, and more
    </Card>

    **Benefits:**
    - Keep all existing subscriptions
    - No need to re-subscribe
    - Works with any email provider
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Direct Subscription">
    **Best for:** New newsletter subscriptions

    When signing up for new newsletters, use your Summate Inbox address directly:

    1. Find a newsletter you want to subscribe to
    2. Enter `username@inbox.summate.io` as your email
    3. Newsletters arrive directly in your Summate Inbox

    **Benefits:**
    - Keeps newsletters separate from personal email
    - No forwarding setup needed
    - Clean inbox from day one
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Why Forwarding Instead of OAuth?

<Info>
**We chose email forwarding for three key reasons:**

1. **You control what we see** - Only emails you explicitly forward reach Summate. Your personal emails, banking statements, and private conversations stay completely private.

2. **Universal compatibility** - Works with every email provider (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, ProtonMail, corporate emails) without special integrations or permissions.

3. **No account access** - We never have access to your email account or password. We can't read emails you don't forward to us.
</Info>

## Using Your Inbox

Access your inbox at [summate.io/v2/inbox](https://summate.io/v2/inbox) to view and manage your newsletters.

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a quick overview of your inbox activity:

<Frame caption="Track senders, emails received, and inbox activity at a glance">
  <img src="/images/inbox/inbox-stats.png" alt="Inbox statistics showing sender counts and email metrics" />
</Frame>

**Statistics shown:**
- **Total Senders** - All email senders you've received
- **Approved** - Senders available as sources (default for all)
- **Blocked** - Spam senders you've blocked
- **Total Emails** - All newsletters received
- **Unread** - Emails you haven't opened yet
- **Active Senders** - Senders who sent emails recently

**Quick access sections:**
- **Recent Emails** - Latest newsletters from approved senders
- **Top Senders** - Most active newsletter sources

### Emails View

View and read all your newsletters in one place.

<Frame caption="Browse and read all your received newsletters in one place">
  <img src="/images/inbox/inbox-emails.png" alt="Emails view showing full list of received newsletters" />
</Frame>

**Features:**
- Search emails by subject or sender
- Filter by specific senders
- Read full email content
- See when emails arrived
- Track unread status

<Tip>
Use the Emails view to read newsletters directly in Summate before adding them to your digests. This helps you verify which sources are worth including.
</Tip>

### Senders Management

Manage all your email senders and control what appears in your digests.

<Frame caption="Approve or block newsletter senders to control your digest sources">
  <img src="/images/inbox/inbox-senders.png" alt="Senders view showing approved and blocked senders" />
</Frame>

**Sender states:**
- **Approved** - Default state for all received newsletters. Available as sources in Email blocks.
- **Blocked** - Spam senders you've blocked. Won't appear in digests or as source options.

**Actions:**
- **Block** - Remove spam senders with one click
- **Approve** - Restore blocked senders if needed
- View email count and last received date for each sender

<Note>
All senders are approved by default. You only need to take action to block spam or unwanted senders.
</Note>

## Adding Newsletters to Digests

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Edit Digest">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Email Block">
    Add an Email block to your digest
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Senders">

  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Newsletters not appearing in Inbox" icon="envelope">
    **Check these common issues:**
    - Verify your forwarding rules are active in your email provider
    - Make sure you're using the correct inbox address
    - For Outlook/Microsoft 365 users: Check that external forwarding is enabled (see our [auto-forwarding guide](/guides/auto-forwarding))
    - Check your email provider's spam folder - newsletters might be blocked before forwarding
    - Wait a few minutes - emails can take up to 5 minutes to appear
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How quickly do emails appear?" icon="clock">
    Forwarded emails typically appear in your inbox within seconds to a few minutes of being forwarded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I forward all my emails?" icon="question">
    Technically yes, but we **strongly recommend** using filters to forward only newsletters. This protects your privacy and keeps your sources relevant. See our [auto-forwarding guide](/guides/auto-forwarding) for filter setup instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to blocked senders?" icon="ban">
    Blocked senders remain visible in the Senders view (marked as "Blocked") but:
    - Won't appear as options in Email blocks
    - Won't show up in Recent Emails or Top Senders
    - Won't be included in any digests

    You can approve them again if you change your mind.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my forwarded content secure?" icon="shield">
    Yes. We store emails securely for up to 1 year to enable the reading experience and digest generation. You can delete individual emails or all data anytime from your inbox at [summate.io/v2/inbox](https://summate.io/v2/inbox).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my inbox username?" icon="at">
    No. You can only create your inbox address once, so choose carefully! This is to ensure address uniqueness and prevent confusion.
  </Accordion>
