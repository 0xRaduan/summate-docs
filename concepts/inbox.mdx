description: Understanding your AI inbox for newsletter collection
---

Your AI inbox is a unique email address that collects newsletters for your digests while keeping your personal emails private.

## Your Inbox Address

Every Summate user gets a unique forwarding address:

```
username@inbox.summate.io
```

Forward newsletters to this address, and they'll automatically appear in your content sources.

## Privacy & Security First

<Info>
**Why we use forwarding instead of OAuth access:**

1. **You control what we see** - Only emails you explicitly forward reach Summate. Your personal emails, banking statements, and private conversations stay completely private.

2. **Universal compatibility** - Works with every email provider without special integrations or permissions.

3. **No inbox access** - We never have access to your email account or password. We can't read emails you don't forward to us.
</Info>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up forwarding">
    Configure your email to forward newsletters to your AI inbox.

    See our [complete forwarding guide](/guides/auto-forwarding) for Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Newsletters arrive">
    Forwarded emails are received and stored in your inbox. You can view all senders and their emails at [summate.io/v2/inbox](https://summate.io/v2/inbox).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage senders">
    Review your senders and emails in your inbox:
    - See all newsletters received
    - Block spam or unwanted senders
    - Keep your sources clean
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to digests">
    Include newsletters in your digests by adding an Email block and selecting which senders to include.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Card title="Block Spam" icon="ban">
    Remove unwanted senders so they won't appear in any digests
  </Card>

### Using Newsletters in Digests

To include newsletters in your digest:
1. Create or edit a digest
2. Add an **Email block**
3. Select which senders to include
4. Configure summary settings

Blocked senders won't appear as options in your Email blocks.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
1. **Use filters** - Don't forward everything, only newsletters
2. **Start small** - Forward a few newsletters first to test
3. **Review weekly** - Check your inbox for new senders
4. **Keep it clean** - Block spam and remove sources you no longer read
</Tip>
