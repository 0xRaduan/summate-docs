description: Understanding your AI inbox for newsletter collection
---

Your AI inbox is a smart email address that automatically collects, processes, and organizes your newsletter subscriptions for inclusion in digests.

## What is the AI Inbox?

Every Summate user gets a unique email address:
```
username@inbox.summate.io
```

This inbox acts as your content collection point. Forward your newsletters here, and Summate automatically:
- Identifies newsletter content vs regular email
- Extracts and processes the content
- Makes it available for your digests
- Manages sender approvals

## How It Works

### The Flow
1. **Forward** newsletters to your AI inbox
2. **AI processes** the content automatically
3. **Smart detection** identifies newsletters vs other emails
4. **Content extraction** pulls text, images, and links
5. **Available in blocks** for digest creation

### Smart Processing

The AI inbox includes:
- **Newsletter detection** - Distinguishes newsletters from transactional emails
- **Sender verification** - Tracks and approves legitimate sources
- **Content extraction** - Pulls full content even from link-only emails
- **Spam filtering** - Blocks promotional and unwanted content
