Summate uses AI to transform hours of reading into digestible summaries tailored to your interests. Our AI continuously monitors your sources and creates personalized summaries based on your custom instructions.

## How AI Summarization Works

We continuously monitor new content from your sources. Before sending out your digest, our AI processes each piece of content according to your custom instructions, extracting what matters most to you.

## Customization Levels

You can customize how AI summarizes your content at three different levels:

### Block Level Custom Instructions
Applied only to a specific block within your digest.

**Use case:** You want different summarization approaches for different content types.

**Example:** "Focus on actionable insights and code examples" for a technical newsletter block, while using "Highlight market trends and predictions" for a business news block.

### Digest Level Custom Instructions
Applied to all blocks within a single digest.

**Use case:** You want consistent summarization across all content in a particular digest.

**Example:** "Summarize everything with a focus on AI and machine learning applications" for your morning tech digest.

### Account Level User Context
Applied across all digests in your account.

**Use case:** You want to provide general context about yourself that influences all summaries.

**Example:** "I'm a software engineer interested in developer tools, productivity, and AI" - this helps the AI understand what's relevant to you across all your digests.

<Info>
Custom instructions at different levels work together. The AI considers account-level context first, then applies digest-level instructions, and finally block-level instructions for the most specific guidance.

## Summarization Modes

### Detailed Summaries

Currently available for all content types. Detailed summaries provide:

- **TLDR** - A brief overview of the entire piece
- **Key Takeaways** - Specific points relevant to your custom instructions

#### Interactive References

Detailed summaries include clickable references that take you directly to the source:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Newsletters & RSS">
    Click on any key takeaway to jump to the exact paragraph in the original article where that information appears. Perfect for verifying context or diving deeper into specific points.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="YouTube Videos">
    Each key takeaway links to the most relevant timestamp in the video. Skip directly to the moment when that topic is discussed, saving you time scanning through long videos.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Additional summarization modes (quick scan, key points only) are planned for future release. These will give you more control over summary length and detail level.
