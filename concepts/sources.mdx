description: Understanding and managing your content sources
---

Sources are the individual content providers within your [blocks](/concepts/blocks) - each YouTube channel, RSS blog, or email sender that you add to create your digests.

<Info>
  **Email sources** are managed through your [Inbox](/concepts/inbox) - all
  received newsletters are automatically available as sources. **YouTube and RSS
  sources** are added directly when you create blocks in your digest.
</Info>

## What are Sources?

A source is a specific content provider:

- **Email source** - A particular newsletter sender (e.g., "Morning Brew")
- **YouTube source** - A specific channel (e.g., "Fireship")
- **RSS source** - A blog or website with an RSS feed (e.g., "TechCrunch")

Each [block](/concepts/blocks) in your digest pulls content from the sources you've selected for that block.

## Source Types

### Email Sources

Email newsletters from any platform - Substack, Beehiiv, ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or any email-based newsletter.

**How to add:**

1. Set up your [Summate Inbox](/concepts/inbox)
2. Forward newsletters to your inbox (see our [auto-forwarding guide](/guides/auto-forwarding))
3. New senders appear in your Inbox and are automatically available as sources
4. Add senders to Email blocks
5. Block spam senders with one click if needed

**Management:**

- **Active sources** - Senders available to add to blocks (default for all received newsletters)
- **Blocked sources** - Spam senders you've blocked with one click
- Manage senders through your [Inbox](/concepts/inbox)

### YouTube Sources

Individual YouTube channels you want to follow.

**How to add:**

1. Create a YouTube block in your digest
2. Connect your YouTube account for one-click import of all subscriptions
3. Or paste channel URLs directly

**Management:**

- Filter out Shorts if desired
- Videos with unavailable transcripts are automatically filtered

<Note>
  We plan to add more management tools for YouTube sources in the future.
</Note>

### RSS Sources

Blogs, news sites, and any website with an RSS feed.

**How to add:**

1. Create an RSS block in your digest
2. Enter a website URL - Summate tries to auto-detect the RSS feed
3. Or paste the RSS feed URL directly if auto-detection doesn't work

**Management:**

- Short content (less than 10 words) is automatically filtered

<Note>We plan to add more management tools for RSS sources in the future.</Note>

## Managing Email Sources

Email sources have the most management tools available for controlling what appears in your digests.

### Managing Senders

When a new newsletter arrives in your [Summate Inbox](/concepts/inbox), it's automatically available as a source.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Your Inbox">
    Check your [Inbox](/concepts/inbox) for newsletter senders
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Blocks">Add senders to Email blocks in your digests</Step>
  <Step title="Block Spam">
    If spam newsletters appear, block them with one click
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Focus on quality newsletters. If low-value content makes it through your
  forwarding filters, block those senders immediately to keep your Inbox clean.
</Tip>

### Source States

- **Active** - All newsletter senders received in your Inbox (default state)
- **Blocked** - Spam senders you've blocked that won't appear in your digests or Inbox

## Source Quality

<Warning>
  We recommend monitoring high-quality sources only, not spam or low-value
  content. Quality sources lead to better digests and more efficient use of your
  AI credits.
</Warning>
