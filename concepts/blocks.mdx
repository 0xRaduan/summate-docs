description: Understanding content blocks - the building units of your digests

Blocks are modular content sections within your digests. Each block connects to specific source types and can be independently configured for optimal content presentation.

## What are Blocks?

Think of blocks as content containers. Each digest can have multiple blocks, and each block pulls from different sources. This modular approach lets you mix newsletters, YouTube videos, and RSS feeds in a single digest while maintaining control over how each type is summarized.

## Block Types

### ðŸ“§ Newsletter Blocks
Pull content from email newsletters and subscriptions.

**Setup:**
1. Forward newsletters to your AI inbox: `username@inbox.summate.io`
2. Summate auto-discovers and categorizes newsletters
3. Select which senders to include in this block

**Features:**
- Smart sender detection (newsletter vs transactional)
- Archive access for past newsletters
- Automatic approval for known publishers

### ðŸ“º YouTube Blocks
Summarize videos from channels you follow.

**Setup Options:**
- Paste channel URLs directly
- Search by channel name
- Bulk import from connected YouTube account

**Configuration:**
- Video count and recency filters
- Duration filters (skip shorts or long videos)
- Type filters (exclude livestreams, premieres)

**Output Features:**
- Timestamped highlights
- Key takeaways with timecodes
- Visual markers at important moments

### ðŸ“° RSS Blocks
Aggregate content from blogs, news sites, and RSS/Atom feeds.

**Adding Sources:**
- Enter website URL (auto-detects feed)
- Direct RSS/Atom URL input
- Browse popular sources by category

**Advanced Options:**
- Full text extraction
- Category and author filtering
- Image inclusion settings

## Customizing Summaries

### Summary Formats

**Quick Scan** (30 seconds/item)
- 2-3 bullet points
- Just essentials
- Best for daily news

**Balanced** (1-2 minutes/item)
- AI paragraph + key takeaways
- Default for most users
- Good detail/time ratio

**Deep Dive** (3-5 minutes/item)
- Extended summaries
- All takeaways + quotes
- Perfect for research

### Per-Block Settings

Control each block independently:

**Content Focus**
- Keywords to emphasize
- Topics to skip
- Relevance scoring (1-10 scale)

**Tone Options**
- Professional (formal, fact-focused)
- Conversational (friendly, accessible)
- Technical (detailed, precise)
- Simple (ELI5 explanations)

**Smart Filtering**
- Minimum relevance scores
- Duplicate detection
- Content age limits

## Block Organization

### Ordering Blocks
Blocks appear in your digest in the order you arrange them. Common patterns:

1. **Priority Order**: Most important sources first
2. **Source Type**: All newsletters, then YouTube, then RSS
3. **Topic Grouping**: Related content together
4. **Time Investment**: Quick reads first, deep dives last

### Block Limits
- Maximum 10 blocks per digest
- No limit on sources per block
- Each block processes independently

## Advanced Features

### Cross-Block Deduplication
When enabled, Summate identifies similar stories across blocks and consolidates them, showing the most comprehensive version.

### Block Templates
Save block configurations as templates for reuse:
- "Tech News" template with favorite tech RSS feeds
- "Industry Newsletters" with approved senders
- "Learning Videos" with educational YouTube channels

### Conditional Blocks
Set blocks to only appear when content meets criteria:
- Minimum item count
- Relevance threshold
- Specific keywords present

## Best Practices

1. **Start with 2-3 blocks** - Add more as you refine
2. **Group similar sources** - All newsletters in one block
3. **Test summary lengths** - Find your ideal detail level
4. **Review weekly** - Remove inactive sources
5. **Use relevance filters** - Quality over quantity
