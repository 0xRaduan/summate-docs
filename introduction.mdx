## What is Summate?

Instead of checking multiple inboxes, apps, and websites throughout the day, Summate automatically:
- **Collects** content from your newsletters, YouTube subscriptions, and RSS feeds
- **Summarizes** everything using AI based on your interests and custom instructions
- **Delivers** personalized digests on your schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly)

    Add newsletters via email forwarding, import YouTube subscriptions, or connect RSS feeds from your favorite blogs.

    Build digests by adding blocks for different content types. Organize by topic, source type, or reading time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize AI Summaries">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive on Schedule">
