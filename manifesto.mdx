# Time is the most valuable human asset

We believe that time is the most precious and scarce resource that we have.

Everyone is trying to fight for your time.

- Work
- Family
- Friends
- Hobbies
- Media
- News

We believe in the age of AI, humans will be able to focus on things that actually matter to them, and all mundane things will be handled by AI.

We live in an age of information abundance. Age of Information Overload.

Too many interesting things to read, watch, listen are getting released every day, ever hour, every minute.

Summate is building a system that will help you keep up with everything that matters to you, yet spend fraction of your time, and be always up to date.

Our AI will catch up on everything important **for you**, and let you ignore the rest, while highlighting the most important things for you to focus on.
