## Reading Interface

### Navigation

The web reader provides two views for navigating your digest:

**Canvas View (Reading List)**
- See all items in the current digest
- Navigate between items with keyboard shortcuts
- Visual overview of content blocks
- Quick scanning through summaries

**Detail View (Content Sheet)**
- Full content display for selected item
- Embedded emails, videos, and blog posts
- Toggle summary and takeaways sections
- Read full original content without leaving the digest

### Embedded Content Rendering

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email Content">
    Full newsletter emails render directly in the digest reader using the same interface as the [Inbox](/concepts/inbox):
    - Original formatting preserved
    - Images and links intact
    - No need to switch to email client
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="YouTube Videos">
    Videos play in an embedded player with full controls:
    - Play/pause and speed adjustment
    - Timestamp jumps from AI takeaways
    - Keyboard shortcuts for playback control
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="RSS Blogs">
    Blog posts and articles display with clean formatting:
    - Readable typography
    - Images and embedded media
    - Links to original source
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
The web reader is especially useful on **desktop** where keyboard shortcuts make navigation significantly faster than scrolling through email.

## Different Summary Types

Summary formats vary based on your [AI customization settings](/concepts/ai-features). Each format offers different features for interacting with content.

### Detailed Summaries

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on key takeaways">
    Each takeaway is clickable in both summary and detail views
  </Step>
  <Step title="Jump to exact context">
    - **Email content**: Scrolls to the specific paragraph in the embedded email
    - **YouTube videos**: Jumps video to the exact timestamp in the embedded player
    - **RSS posts**: Links to the relevant section in the embedded blog post
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read or watch in place">
