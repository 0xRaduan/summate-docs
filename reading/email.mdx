Receive your personalized digests directly in your inbox, formatted for easy reading.

## How It Works

Your email digest displays blocks as separate sections, appearing in the same order you arranged them in the digest builder. Each block contains summaries from its connected sources.

### Newsletter Summaries

For newsletter content, each summary includes:
- AI-generated summary with key points
- **Click to Read** button that jumps to the exact section in the original email
- Source attribution and publish date

## Deliverability

### Ensuring Delivery

To receive your digests reliably:
1. Whitelist `hello@summate.io` in your email client
2. Check spam/promotions folders initially
3. Mark as "Not Spam" if found there

### Email Clients

Summate digests work with all major email clients:
- Gmail (Web & Mobile)
- Apple Mail
- Outlook
- Yahoo Mail
- ProtonMail

## Reading Experience

### Mobile Optimized
Digests are responsive and readable on all devices, with touch-friendly buttons and clear typography.

### Large Digests
Some email clients like Gmail may clip very long digests. If you see a "View entire message" link at the bottom, we recommend using the web version link at the top of your digest for the best reading experience.

### Rendering Issues
If you experience formatting problems:
- Try viewing in a different email client
- Use the web version link at the top of each digest
- Report persistent issues to support@summate.io
