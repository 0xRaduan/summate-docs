## How Email Digests Work

Your digest appears as a single email with blocks displayed as separate sections. Each block contains AI-generated summaries from its connected sources, appearing in the same order you arranged them in the digest builder.

### What You See

Each item in your digest includes:
- **TLDR summary** - Quick overview of the content
- **Key takeaways** - Important points and insights
- **Source attribution** - Newsletter sender, video channel, or blog
- **Links to full content** - Read the original source

<Info>
All summaries are generated using your [AI customization settings](/concepts/ai) at the block, digest, or account level.
</Info>

## Different Summary Types

Summary formats vary based on your [AI customization settings](/concepts/ai). Each format offers different features for interacting with content.

### Detailed Summaries

When using the **Detailed Summaries** format, you get interactive references that work directly in your email client:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on key takeaways">
    Each takeaway in Detailed Summaries is clickable
  </Step>
  <Step title="Jump to exact context">
    - **Email content**: Jumps to the specific paragraph in the original email
    - **YouTube videos**: Opens video at the exact timestamp
    - **RSS posts**: Links to the relevant section in the blog post
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read full content">
    Access complete newsletters, videos, and articles from digest links
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Interactive references make it easy to verify AI summaries or dive deeper into specific points without losing your place in the digest.
</Tip>

<Info>
More summary formats with unique interactive features are coming soon.

## Reading Experience

### Email Client Compatibility

Digests work with all major HTML-capable email clients:
- Gmail (Web & Mobile)
- Apple Mail
- Outlook
- Yahoo Mail
- ProtonMail
- Spark

### Large Digests

Some email clients (especially Gmail) may clip very long digests. If you see "View entire message" at the bottom, click the **"Read on Web"** link at the top of your digest for the full experience.

<Warning>
Email client formatting can be restrictive. For the best reading experience with embedded content and interactive features, use the [web reader](/reading/web).
</Warning>
