## Organizing Multiple Digests

### Common Patterns

### Managing Digests

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** - Create one digest first, then expand
2. **Group related content** - Keep topics focused
3. **Test schedules** - Adjust timing based on your routine
4. **Use templates** - Modify pre-made digests vs starting fresh
